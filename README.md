# Assembly OS Project

Assembly OS Project! This repository is attempting to create a simple operating system using assembly language.

## Tutorial Source

We are following the tutorial by **Nanobyte**, which provides a comprehensive guide to building an operating system from scratch. You can find the tutorial on the [Nanobyte YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9t-SPC7Tczc&list=PLFjM7v6KGMpiH2G-kT781ByCNC_0pKpPN&index=2).

## Additional Resources

For more information, tips, and updates related to this project, check out the **Daedalus Community** channel. They offer additional content and insights into operating system development. Here's an example video:
